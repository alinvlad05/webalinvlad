        <h1>Central processing unit</h1>
        <p class="lead">At the heart of your phone lies its processor, or CPU. This is effectively the brain of your device, and its specs determine whether your phone feels "fast" or "slow."
            <br>
        </p>
        <img style="height: 800px;width: 800px"  src="cpu/cpu.jpg" alt="cpu">
        <h1>CPU Frequency</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            The most fundamental measurement of a processor's quickness is its clock speed, which is usually represented as a gigahertz value. Today's fastest mobile processors have clock speeds ranging from 1.8 GHz to 2.2 GHz, though anything above 1 GHz should be acceptable.
            <br>
            Beyond clock speed, a second factor to consider here is the processor's die size. For the sake of simplicity, this is the size of the physical pieces that make up a CPU. Everything else being equal, a smaller die size is superior because less heat is generated, meaning less energy is wasted. Today's top mobile processors have a 14-nanometer die size, and the generation before this one sported 20-nanometer dies, so anything in that range should be your target here.
        </p>
        <h1>CPU Cores</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Nowadays, you'll be hard-pressed to find a single-core processor. With the advent of multi-core processors, the days of apps freezing or locking when the operating system was maxing out the CPU are long gone, as additional processes can now be handled by a different processor core.
            So multi-core processors are obviously better, but how many cores do you need? The short answer is "at least two cores".
            <br>
            First, as long as a processor has at least two cores, clock speed should still be the main differentiating factor when picking a CPU. A dual-core processor with higher clock speeds will usually outperform a chip that has lower clock speeds, but more cores. This is because most apps are programmed to only run on one CPU core at a time, so the faster the individual core performance, the better.
            <br>
            But a second factor to consider here is that some graphics-intensive apps can indeed distribute their workload across multiple cores. Mobile games are just now starting to be programmed this way, as are photo and video editing apps. For these types of apps, a CPU with more cores will be beneficial.
            <br>
            In summary, always look for a CPU with fast clock speeds, regardless of the amount of cores it has. But if you're a gamer, a graphics artist, or a video editor, a CPU with lots of cores may indeed be a better fit—though only if the clock speed is still on par with your other options.
        </p>
        <h1>SoC Ranking</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Chipset basically is the motherboard in a phone or in other words, its a mother of board which accepts all the components to sit upon it, and connect with each other.
            <br>
            CPU is the Central Processing Unit which is responsible for carrying out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system.
            <br>
            In a mobile phone, combination of Chipset and CPU is called a SoC (System on Chip) which integrates all the components on a single chip.
