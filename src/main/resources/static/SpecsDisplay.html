                <p style="font-size: 20px">Lots of manufacturers have been focused on improving the screen size and resolution to provide a preferable viewing experience for consumers. For this purpose, the screen resolution of a mobile phone has been significantly increased, from the incipient QCIF (176 × 144) or even smaller to the current Quad HD (2560 × 1440) or even Ultra HD (3840 × 2160).</p>

            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <p style="font-size: 20px">The screen size has also been enlarged from smaller than 1 inch to 5.7 inches or even larger as the flagship of industrial standards. It is reported that nearly one-third of smartphones sold in 2012 had a screen size larger than 4.5 inches, and the smartphones with 4.5-inch screens or more have represented almost 80% of all new models till May 2014. The screen resolution and size are now regarded as two key choice factors for smartphones.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Screen resolution <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
                <p class="lead" style="color: black">Screens are made up of thousands of pixels, and by changing the colours of pixels in certain patterns, the screens can show images, photos, text and all kinds of graphics.
                    Screen resolution is the number of pixels a screen can show, both horizontally and vertically. So, a screen that has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 (a popular resolution that's also known as 1080p or Full HD), can display 1,080 pixels vertically, and 1,920 pixels horizontally.
                    The higher the number of pixels a screen can show, the sharper and more detailed the image quality is. The number of pixels a screen can show isn't the only factor when it comes to image quality – there's also pixel density. You see, monitors come in all kinds of sizes, as well as resolutions, and you often get monitors of different sizes that have the same number of pixels.

                <p class="lead" style="color: black">You can have a 24-inch monitor with a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080, as well as a 32-inch monitor with that same screen resolution. The image quality on the smaller monitor can often look sharper and more vivid, and that's because of its pixel density. This is measured in PPI (Pixels Per Inch). So, the smaller screen will have a higher number of pixels per inch than the larger screen. 
                    The higher the PPI, the better the image quality, so while it might be tempting to go for the largest screen possible, if you're after the highest image quality, consider getting a smaller monitor with a higher resolution, rather than a larger monitor with a lower resolution.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Screen refresh rate <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
                <p class="lead" style="color: black">A refresh rate is the number of times your monitor updates with new images each second. For example, a 60 Hz refresh rate means the display updates 60 times per second. A higher refresh rate results in a smoother picture.

                    The refresh rate is a measure for the number of times a screens redraws an image. It is measured in Hertz (Hz). Most smartphones today are equipped with 60Hz screens, irrespective of the price.

                    A higher refresh rate display largely enhances your smartphone experience. Scrolling through the app drawer, images and webpages becomes so much smoother. If you spend a lot of time looking at your phone screen, higher refresh rates can make your eyes feel a lot less tired. Even the gaming experience becomes sleeker. Fast-paced games such as PlayerUnknown’s Battleground, Asphalt 9: Legends are optimised to use high refresh rate screens, although you might have to turn these on manually. With it, you’ll see smoother graphics, finer details, no lag or jittering which enhances the overall gaming experience. Everything feels much more responsive.
