        <h1 class="cover-heading">Why is 5G a game changer?</h1>
        <p>The short answer to why 5G is a game changer: it will improve your network connection dramatically. You won’t have to deal with disruptions when sharing videos from crowded arenas, nor will high-quality videos on your newsfeed cause frustration from all the buffering.
        Instead, you’ll get a faster, more stable, more secure connection – along with new services and experiences, just around the corner. More efficient capabilities and vastly increased capacity means you’ll enjoy better performance than ever before.</p>

        <h2 class="cover-heading">Data rates</h2>
        <p >100 times faster, supporting instant access to services and applications.</p>
        <h2 class="cover-heading">Network latency</h2>
        <p >significantly reduced to 1-10ms.</p>


        <h2 class="cover-heading">2G</h2>
        <p >2G networks ( GSM) are now pretty old technology (becoming common around 1992), but cover the vast majority of the UK. they were designed primarily for voice and text.
            2G networks are also capable of transferring data, but only very slowly and unreliably. </p>
        <h2 class="cover-heading">3G</h2>
        <p >3G networks are a progression from 2G, starting around 2001, and are primarily designed to handle data transfer. Standard 3G (UMTS) is capable of speeds up to 2Mb. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="cover-heading">4G</h2>
        <p >4G is the fastest mobile internet most of us can get right now. The first 4G network was launched in the UK in November 2012 by EE, and all the networks now offer 4G services. While coverage is not quite as widespread as 3G it is available in many locations.
        </p>
        <h2 class="cover-heading">5G</h2>
        <p >5G is the very latest generation of mobile communications. It's extremely fast, but coverage is currently very limited. Like the early days of 4G, it's mainly found in specific locations in major cities.
