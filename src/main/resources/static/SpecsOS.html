        <h1 class="cover-heading">What is a mobile operating system? </h1>
        <p class="lead">Whether it's a laptop, desktop computer, smartphone, tablet, or smart watch, operating systems serve as graphical software overlays for controlling the device's internal hardware.</p>
        <p class="lead">Most mobile OS present as a graphical display of buttons, icons, windows, and tiles that you can touch or interact with to perform various tasks. This visual architecture is the backbone of the operating system. Without the OS, the device would be a series of command prompts and inscrutable computer code.
            The mobile operating system manages the hardware and makes it possible for smartphones, tablets, and wearables to run apps and other programs in a user-friendly way.
            A mobile OS also manages mobile multimedia functions, mobile and internet connectivity, touch screen controls, Bluetooth connectivity, GPS navigation, cameras, speech recognition, and more.
            Most operating systems are not interchangeable. For example, if you have a Samsung phone, which runs the Android OS, you cannot use it to run Apple iOS, which is the operating system used to run iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches.

        <h1 class="cover-heading">Google's Android</h1>
        <p class="lead">Android, modeled after Linux , is the world's most popular mobile OS. Its popularity is largely driven by Google's distribution model: Android is an open source project that gives phone manufacturers and cell phone carriers free license to use Android and modify the core OS for their devices. Although most Android instances stick closely to the core, the freedom to modify Android has led to many challenges, in what is now referred to as Android fragmentation.</p>
        <p class="lead">Even so, Android continues to grow bigger and more powerful with each new version. In August 2018, Google released Android 9.0 Pie, which incorporates artificial intelligence into the platform, making it possible for a device to adapt to user activity.
