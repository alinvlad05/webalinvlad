            <h1 class="display-3">Memory</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 27px;font-family: 'Calibri Light'">Phone's memory includes RAM and ROM. RAM(Random Access Memory) equals the memory (or memory bar) of the computer, while ROM(Read Only Memory) is the device's internal storage, equaling the hard disk of the computer.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Calibri Light'">RAM Memory</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;font-family: 'Times New Roman'">RAM stands for Random Access Memory which is a small part of the memory. It stores the "frequently" used items so that the processor  does not have to go all the way to the internal memory and then find the item the user has requested for.
                    It stores the references of the files you have recently used just because the system thinks that you may need them again and it provides you with a faster service.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;font-family: 'Times New Roman'">
                    In simple words, RAM would help you achieve multitasking abilities.
                    A RAM with 512MB capacity would also make a system work well but you may not be able to have smooth and fast multitasking experiences with the same. The better the capacity of the RAM, the better the performance of the system. 2GB is a good capacity for a RAM though.
                    RAM is very fast but volatile, meaning that all information is lost when electric power is cut off, allowing data to be read or written irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. Devices with more RAM can run more complex software and multiple applications at the same time. </p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Calibri Light'">ROM Memory</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 21px;font-family: 'Times New Roman'">ROM (Read Only Memory) is a form of data storage. This type of memory keeps the saved data even if the device power is off. The word Read-only identifies it as "read-only memory", since the reprogramming process is generally infrequent, comparatively slow, and often does not permit random access writes to individual memory locations.</p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: 21px"> It equals a hard disk in a computer, storing various of files, including videos, songs, photos, and system software, etc. At present, most smartphones are equipped with 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, or even 128GB, 256GB large ROM.In other words,the disk / flash/ hard disk/ internal memory are where you store your permanent files. The songs, videos, images, and all other documents in your cell phone are stored in the internal memory. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Calibri Light'">Memory card slot</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 27px;font-family: 'Times New Roman'">A special slot for inserting a memory card. Memory cards allow you to expand the phone's built-in memory.
                    Memory cards have different capacities and are used to store and transfer files between compatible devices.</p><p style="font-size: 27px;font-family: 'Times New Roman'"> There are several types of memory cards. The most popular and frequently used by mobile phone manufacturers is microSD;Memory card slots can have various supported memory card capacities.</p>
